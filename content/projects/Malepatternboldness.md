👨‍🦲Oh no, you're losing your hair!
But perhaps you can use something around to cover it up…

5 levels, 5 life events, you can do it!


Entered into Ludum Dare 50 with Adam Butcher, Tom Carrell and James Pearson. MPB was made in 3 days. It was our first bash at entering a game jam and we had a whole bunch of fun telling the story of baldo (a returning character!). Also Tom was really cooking with the music, it's a tune that live in your head a long time, you have been warned!

The theme of the competition was 'delaying the inevitable'. It comes for us all.
