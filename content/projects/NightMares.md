Our entry for the Tiny Horse Game Jam 2. This was a non-competitive jam, the community were so friendly and supportive it was almost embarrassing to have the only violent game of the jam! Though we like to think that added some variety in the mix.

Art by Sara. Game code by myself. Sara even set us up with an online leaderboard!

Horses with guns was already a winning combo but we added the idea of coop weapon synergies to the mix.
