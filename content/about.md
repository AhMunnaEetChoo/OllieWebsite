Hi! I'm senior games programmer with over a decade of experience. I've covered engine development, animation systems, VR, back + front end web dev, management and more.

I truly love making things. It's good for the soul. I've been involved in game jams, one in particular won Ludum Dare 54 - [Stretchmancer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2929290/Stretchmancer/) which we're expanding into a full game!

I studied physics and programming before joining the industry and have spent the bulk of my time in Cambridge with Frontier.
