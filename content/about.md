Hi! I'm a programmer with over a decade of experience in games development. I was recently working as Lead Animation Programmer at Frontier Developments. I've covered engine development, animation systems, VR, back + front end web dev and management to name a few prominent areas.

I truly love making things. It's good for the soul. I've been involved in game jams, one in particular won Ludum Dare 54 - [Stretchmancer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2929290/Stretchmancer/) which we're now expanding into a full game.

I studied physics and programming before joining the industry and have spent the bulk of my time in Cambridge with Frontier.
