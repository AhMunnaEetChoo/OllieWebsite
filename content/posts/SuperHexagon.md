In 2012 I got absorbed by Terry Cavanagh's fantastic twitch game - Super Hexagon. So absorbed I became number 1 in the world at all levels for a few months.

Super Hexagon is one of the best games I know that can achieve 'flow' state in the player. I was on the sofa with an iPad in hand - I could have a conversation with one part of my brain while the other was in the zone.

Kotaku covered my record in an article [here](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/10/this-insane-super-hexagon-run-maybe-just-be-a-new-world-record/)
