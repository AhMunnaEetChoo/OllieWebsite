Hello! I'm lead animation engineer at Frontier. We're all about creating massive sandboxes full of reactive and detailed creature animation, super fun! Wibbling things with maths. 

I'm also an indie game romantic. Recently I've been jumping into a few game jams with some talented friends. Our games our wild.
